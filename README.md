✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Start the application

Run `npx nx dev monorepo` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build monorepo` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

-   [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
-   [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
-   [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.

## IMPORTANT for new Next.js apps that will be deployed to Vercel

This should be the content for `next.config.js` file:

```
const { PrismaPlugin } = require('@prisma/nextjs-monorepo-workaround-plugin');

module.exports = {
    webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
        if (isServer) {
            config.plugins = [...config.plugins, new PrismaPlugin()];
        }

        return config;
    },
};
```

Make sure that the `index.d.ts` file contains: `declare module '@prisma/nextjs-monorepo-workaround-plugin';`

## Vercel Deployment

Override `Build command`: `nx run prisma-schema-app-1:generate && npx nx build monorepo-social --prod`

Override `Output Directory`: `apps/monorepo-social/.next`

## Clerk Webhooks

Create a new API endpoint to receive a Webhook call (e.g. `/api/webhooks/route.ts`). Add the Webhook endpoint on Clerk's dashboard and select the events you want to subscribe to. Add the signing secret to the environment variables (`WEBHOOK_SECRET`).

## Clerk Testing

To receive calls from Clerk Webhooks when a user creates an account, we need to expose the localhost port by running: `lt --port 3000`
The URL must be updated in the Clerk dashboard for this to work.

## Clerk Session

Session parameters like `full_name` or `primary_email_address` must be added in the Clerk dashboard on the Sessions tab. Clerk will populate these values automatically. https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/configuration/session-options
